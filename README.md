# CISXView

This is a port of a simple IAMMP CIS scan format reader to objective C.  For a complete description of the IAMMP *.CIS file type see the Preview of “Microsoft Word - CIS_File_Format.doc”.pdf that
should be in this repository.

More informatin can be had at IAMMP.org and the associated Yahoo e-group <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Rollscanners> which was a deep time archive gathering
traffic in 5 to 10 year cycles.  There may of may not be mirror archives on that discussion group.  Perhaps some day something better will come along.

This code is placed here with out any warrenty what so ever.  The data it is intended to read is on average over a century old.  If you want to preserve this data 
copy it as much as you can.
